## Overview

The FRIENDS framework provides a systematic approach to research topic selection, ensuring academic rigor and feasibility. This document demonstrates how this MSc AI project aligns with each criterion.

## Framework Application

| Letter | Attribute | Application to Maize Disease Classification Project |
|--------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **F** | **Feasible** | ✅ Access to primary data from family farm in the village<br>✅ Local development environment (C:\websites\mastersaiproject)<br>✅ Available computational resources for deep learning<br>✅ Realistic 3-month timeline for MSc completion |
| **R** | **Relevant** | ✅ Maize is a staple crop in Kenya (national food security)<br>✅ Maize Lethal Necrosis (MLN) and Streak Virus are major threats<br>✅ Addresses real-world agricultural challenges<br>✅ Aligns with Kenya Vision 2030 agricultural goals |
| **I** | **Interesting** | ✅ Personal connection to farming community<br>✅ Combines AI expertise with agricultural impact<br>✅ Aligns with OUK MSc in AI curriculum<br>✅ Potential for community benefit and knowledge transfer |
| **E** | **Ethical** | ✅ No human or animal subjects involved<br>✅ Plant-based research (minimal ethical concerns)<br>✅ Permission obtained from farm neighbors for crop photography<br>✅ Data privacy maintained (no personal information collected) |
| **N** | **Narrow** | ✅ **Specific scope:** Computer Vision for 3 maize disease states<br>✅ **Geographic focus:** Uasin Gishu region, Kenya<br>✅ **Technical focus:** CNN-based image classification<br>✅ **Not:** Broad "AI for Agriculture" - highly focused problem |
| **D** | **Discipline** | ✅ Sits within Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence<br>✅ Utilizes Deep Learning (CNNs, Transfer Learning)<br>✅ Incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques<br>✅ Follows established ML research methodology |
| **S** | **Supervisor** | ✅ Professional topic suitable for OUK standards<br>✅ "Mentoring-friendly" (Quadrant I in Adhikari's matrix)<br>✅ Clear deliverables and evaluation metrics<br>✅ Appropriate scope for MSc-level research |

## Research Gap Identification

### Existing Research
Most international studies focus on:
- PlantVillage datasets (controlled laboratory conditions)
- Standardized lighting and backgrounds
- Curated, high-quality images

### Identified Gap
**"The lack of AI diagnostic accuracy in the specific variable lighting conditions and soil types of smallholder farms in Uasin Gishu, Kenya."**

This project addresses:
1. **Real-world conditions:** Variable lighting, natural backgrounds
2. **Local context:** Specific to Kenyan farming practices
3. **Practical deployment:** Designed for field use by farmers
4. **Accessibility:** Low-resource computational requirements

## Project Scope Definition

### In Scope
- ✅ Three disease states: Healthy, MLN, Streak Virus
- ✅ Image-based classification using CNNs
- ✅ Model explainability (XAI techniques)
- ✅ Field-captured images from Uasin Gishu region
- ✅ Performance evaluation on local dataset

### Out of Scope
- ❌ Other crops (focus on maize only)
- ❌ Other diseases beyond MLN and Streak
- ❌ Real-time video processing
- ❌ Mobile app deployment (future work)
- ❌ Nationwide deployment infrastructure

## Academic Justification

This project demonstrates:

1. **Methodological Rigor:** Systematic framework-based topic selection
2. **Literature Awareness:** Understanding of existing research and gaps
3. **Practical Impact:** Addresses real agricultural challenges
4. **Technical Depth:** Advanced AI/ML techniques appropriate for MSc level
5. **Ethical Consideration:** Responsible research practices
